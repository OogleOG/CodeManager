# CodeSnippet Manager

A lightweight and modern JavaFX desktop application for managing code snippets.  
This app helps developers organize, search, and reuse their snippets with a clean and professional UI.

CodeSnippetManager - Purpose & Benefits

What does this program do?
--------------------------
CodeSnippetManager is a desktop application designed to help developers manage, search, and share code snippets easily.
It allows you to:
- Save useful code snippets for future reference.
- Organize snippets by project, file, and function name.
- Quickly search through your projects to find specific functions or methods.
- Instantly create GitHub gists from selected snippets to share with others.

Why would you use it?
---------------------
1. **Faster Development**
   - Instead of rewriting common functions or digging through old projects, you can quickly find and reuse existing snippets.

2. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Share useful functions or utilities with your team, community, or friends by creating a GitHub gist directly from the app.

3. **Centralized Snippet Storage**
   - Keep all your frequently used functions and snippets organized in one place, searchable by keyword.

4. **Saves Time & Prevents Errors**
   - No more copy-paste mistakes or forgetting linked code when sharing snippets â€” the tool helps extract and package complete functions.

Who is it for?
--------------
- Individual developers who want to keep a personal snippet library.
- Teams who frequently share code snippets across projects.
- Open-source contributors who want to quickly create gists for bug fixes, utilities, or documentation.

In short:
----------
CodeSnippetManager is your **personal code library + gist generator**, making it easier to organize, find, and share code across all your projects.
